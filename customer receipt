To calculate the total cost for a customer, including tax, and to generate a receipt for their purchase, you can follow these steps in Python. I will create a simple script to:

1. Add items to the customer's purchase.
2. Calculate the subtotal.
3. Apply sales tax.
4. Generate and print a receipt.


# Item descriptions and prices
Lovely_Loveseat_description = "Lovely Loveseat. Tufted polyester blend on wood. 32 inches high x 40 inches wide x 30 inches deep. Red or white."
Lovely_Loveseat_price = 254.00

stylish_settee_description = "Stylish settee. Faux leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. Black."
stylish_settee_price = 180.50

Luxurious_lamp_description = "Luxurious Lamp. Glass and iron. 36 inches tall. Brown with cream shade."
Luxurious_lamp_price = 52.15

sales_tax = 0.088  # 8.8%

# Initialize customer details
customer_one_total = 0
customer_one_itemization = ""

# Items purchased by customer one
items_purchased = [
    {"description": Lovely_Loveseat_description, "price": Lovely_Loveseat_price},
    {"description": stylish_settee_description, "price": stylish_settee_price},
    {"description": Luxurious_lamp_description, "price": Luxurious_lamp_price}
]

# Calculate total and itemization
for item in items_purchased:
    customer_one_total += item["price"]
    customer_one_itemization += f"{item['description']} - ${item['price']:.2f}\n"

# Calculate tax and final total
tax_amount = customer_one_total * sales_tax
final_total = customer_one_total + tax_amount

# Generate receipt
receipt = f"Receipt:\n\n{customer_one_itemization}\nSales Tax: ${tax_amount:.2f}\nTotal: ${final_total:.2f}"

print(receipt)
